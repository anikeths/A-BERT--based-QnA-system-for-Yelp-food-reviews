# A-BERT--based-QnA-system-for-Yelp-food-reviews

The goal of this project is to present a Question-and- Answering system to the user.
I have made use of the BERT-based Hugging-Face library.

Here, the reviews collected from Yelp are presented in the form of a dataframe with the help of Streamlit.
The magical functionalities of Streamlit help present the dataframes interactively to the user.

Input is taken in the form of an integer for the row number of the review to be read by the user.
Next, the corresponding text is displayed in the UI window and it is considered the context for which questions can be posed by the user.

Based on the questions asked to the context text, the answer given by the transfromer is presented to the user.

Screenshots to follow.
